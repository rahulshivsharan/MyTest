What are Closures.


Closures are anonimous functions in javascript.

It can be explained from below examples,


var fn = function(){
	alert("  Hi There ");
};
fn();


From the above example be come to know that there is a function 'fn'
and on the next line i am calling the function 'fn()'


But clousure will be as follows

(function(){
	alert(" Hi There ");
})();

here i have written the function as well as calling it.
